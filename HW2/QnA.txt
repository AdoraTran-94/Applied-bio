Find answers to following questions:
1.	Tell us a bit about the organism.
Drosophila melanogaster, known as the fruit fly, a small insect, is a model organism in genetics research and developmental biology.  Due to its genome conserves around 60% of genes with DNA mutations, replication, or deletions in human diseases, scientists have focused on understanding gene expression and development using D. melanogaster {Baenas, 2019 #1}. According to Roger A. Hoskins et al. its genome consists of about 15,682 genes located in four pairs of chromosomes (an X/Y pair and three autosomes) {Hoskins, 2015 #2}. This small organism (2-4 mm long) is often used for research studies due to its rapid generation time including embryo, larva, pupa, and adult around 8.5 days at 25oC with a lifespan of 50 days under optimal conditions {Hoskins, 2015 #2}. It is interesting that there are around 75% of disease genes known in human matches in the genome of the fruit fly {Huang, 2014 #3}. In addition, its genome is relatively small and well-characterized would be useful to study of gene interactions and mutations {Hoskins, 2015 #2}. That is why I am thinking to dig out its sequence genome to find out the characteristics of one particular sequence may be useful for further study of neurodegenerative disorders, aging, immunity, diabetes, and cancer using this insect model.
2.	How many features does the file contain?
# According to literatures, the number of features in a GFF3 file refers to the count of individual genomic elements described in the file. And each non-comment line represents one feature (comment lines start with #). These features include genes, exons, CDS, UTRs, and other genomic elements. And please keep in mind that one gene can have multiple associated features.
-	I unzipped the folder in a folder in the Window and changed to the directory containing the file.
$ cd /mnt/d/2022-2023/Penn_State/Classes/3rd\ semester/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3/
-	Count the number of features in the file
$ grep -v "^#" Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3 | wc -l
#  grep -v "^#": to search the file 
Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3. Then with the -v flag, the command will invert the match, it will exclude lines that start (^) with #. In GFF3 files, lines starting with # are comments or metadata. |: The pipe operator (|) sends the output from grep (the lines that don't start with #) to the next command. Finally, this command will count the number of lines in the output from gret by using wc –l in which the -l flag means "line count."
As the results, there are 128 features in this file.
While this command is used to count each feature type in row 3:
$ grep -v "^#" Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3 | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort –nr
As the results, we got: 
38 exon
24 ncRNA_gene
22 tRNA
13 mRNA
13 gene
13 CDS
2 rRNA
1 region
1 pseudogenic_transcript
1 pseudogene
3.	How many sequence regions (chromosomes) does the file contain? 
$ grep "^##sequence-region" Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3 | wc -l
# grep "^##sequence-region" to find lines that start with ##sequence-region, which define the sequence regions (chromosomes). wc –l to count the number of such lines, which corresponds to the number of sequence regions (chromosomes) in the file.
As the results, there is one sequence region in the file
#To print the ##sequence-region line from the file to the screen:
$ grep "^##sequence-region" Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3
# grep "^##sequence-region" to find the line that starts with ##sequence-region and print the ##sequence-region line on the screen.
The output is: ##sequence-region   mitochondrion_genome 1 19524
4.	How many genes are listed for this organism?
To count the number of genes in the GFF3 file, we need to identify rows where the type of the feature is a gene. In this case, the third column of the GFF3 file indicates the feature type, and "gene" features are likely indicated by terms such as gene, ncRNA_gene, or others.
$ grep -v "^#" Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3 | awk '$3 ~ /gene/' | wc -l
# grep -v "^#" to filter out all comment lines (which start with #). awk '$3 ~ /gene/'to match any line where the feature type contains the word "gene" at the third column. Finally, wc -l counts the number of lines that match, which corresponds to the number of genes listed in the file.
As the results, there are 38 genes in this file.
5.	What are the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome?
$ grep -v "^#" Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.46.112.primary_assembly.mitochondrion_genome.gff3 | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10
# grep -v "^#" to filter out comment lines (which start with #). awk '{print $3}’ to extracts the third column, which contains the feature types. sort to sort the feature types alphabetically. uniq –c to count occurrences of each unique feature type. sort –nr to sort the counts in numerical reverse order (most frequent first). Finally, head -n 10 to display the top ten feature types.
As the results, the top-ten most annotated feature types (column 3) across the genome:
1.	38 exon
2.	24 ncRNA_gene
3.	22 tRNA
4.	13 mRNA
5.	13 gene
6.	13 CDS
7.	2 rRNA
8.	1 region
9.	1 pseudogenic_transcript
10.	1 pseudogene
6.	Having analyzed this GFF file, does it seem like a complete and well-annotated organism?
Yes, it is well-annotated for the mitochondrial genome, containing all essential elements. According to the findings, the file contains 128 features, including exons, ncRNA genes, tRNAs, and other elements for a mitochondrial genome. It showed the most frequent features are 38 Exons, 24 ncRNA genes, 22 tRNAs. This structure suggests thorough annotation of key mitochondrial components. While we found there are 38 genes including protein-coding genes, tRNAs, rRNAs, and pseudogenes, which aligns with expectations for a mitochondrial genome. Even though there is only one sequence Region (chromosome) for the mitochondrial genome, covering positions 1 to 19,524. However, if we only look at this file, it is incomplete for the whole organism because it does not include nuclear genome information.
