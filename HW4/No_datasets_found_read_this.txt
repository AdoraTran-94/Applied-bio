The error message indicates that the datasets command is not found, which likely means the tool you want to use for downloading genome data isn't installed in the bioinfo environment or isnâ€™t accessible due to the activation issue.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Check Installed Packages: First, ensure that the necessary tool (likely ncbi-datasets-cli or similar) is installed in your bioinfo environment. Activate the environment and check:

micromamba activate bioinfo
micromamba list
Look for ncbi-datasets-cli or any relevant tool.

Install Missing Tool: If the tool is not installed, you can install it using:

bash
Copy code
micromamba install -n bioinfo ncbi-datasets-cli
After installation, make sure to activate the environment again:

bash
Copy code
micromamba activate bioinfo
Modify Your Script: If you are still running into issues with activation in the script, you can also run the download command directly with micromamba run:

Update your script to include:

echo "Downloading genome data for GCF_016801865.2..."
micromamba run -n bioinfo datasets download genome accession GCF_016801865.2 --include gff3,cds,protein,rna,genome
Run the Script Again: Save the changes to your script and run it again:

./process_gff.sh
